ca_XX_XXXX.bjson = character hurtbox setup? Comes from collisionGimmickParam.arc


Character Properties ("runnerParam")
gravity: how floaty a character will be. Limit seems to be -100, which is the floatiest a character can be. Anything higher than -100 (-99 and beyond) and the character will not spawn
walkSpeed: speed character moves when stick is tilted slightly
runSpeed: speed character moves when stick is tilted all the way to the left or right
dashSpeed: speed character moves when stick is smashed left or right
jumpSpeedX: speed character moves in the air when drifting in the X direction. The more (+) the number, the faster you will drift
jumpSpeedY: speed character moves vertically in the air. The first number is the speed for the first jump, and the second number is the speed for the double jump. The more (+) the number, the higher you will jump
jumpSpeedYLimit: speed cap on how fast your character moves vertically in the air. Applies to both jumps. The more (-) the number, the faster the speed allowed. If this number is set to (+), your character will start rising into the air at the speed you set it to be
descentSpeed: speed character moves when falling
descentSpeedLimit: speed cap for character when falling


Attack Properties
kind: presumably what kind of attack. I have never seen this be anything other than "STRIKE"
damage: How much damage the attack does to an opponent's health
guardDamage: How much damage the attack does to an opponent's guard
material: controls what damage material is called. These are outlined in the act00_common.json
canGuard: controls if a move can be blocked or not
freezeFrame: How much hitstun is applied when the move connects to an opponent on the ground
freezeFrameGuard: How much hitstun is applied when the move connects to an opponent's guard
freezeFrameAir: How much hitstun is applied when the move connects to an opponent in the air
NOTE FOR ALL HITSTUN: The more (-) the number, the less hitlag will be incurred. -100 doesn't make opponent flinch at all. Likewise the more (+) the number, the more hitlag the opponent will endure
kbSpeed: Strength of knockback the attack does on grounded opponents. First number is kb in the X direction, second number is kb in the Y direction
kbAirSpeed: Strength of knockback the attack does on opponents in the air. First number is kb in the X direction, second number is kb in the Y direction
hitStopFrame: How many frames of hitlag you experience when the move connects
isConflict: controls if a move can initiate a conflict, where characters are locked in a mashing sequence
boneName: The bone of the character model that the hitbox is generated
shape: The shape of the hitbox. Generally these are "SPHERE", but I have also seen "CAPSULE"


Move Input notes (attackerParam)
kind: How hard you press the stick. Normal = tilt input, Strong_Stick = tap input.
stick: What direction the stick is pressed. The directions (going clockwise) is UP, RIGHT_UP, RIGHT, RIGHT_DOWN, DOWN, LEFT_DOWN, LEFT, and LEFT_UP
button: What button is pressed. Options include: ATTACK, STRONG_ATTACK, SPECIAL, GRAB
